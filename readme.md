This is the complete source code for Qoole 99 v0.99.

The projects have been tested with Visual C++ 6.0, and Intel C/C++ Compiler 4.5
(but the last one is not needed, you can compile with Visual C++ 6.0 compiler).

The code is all licensed under the terms of the GPL (gnu public license).
You should read the entire license, but the gist of it is that you can do
anything you want with the code, including sell your new version. The catch
is that if you distribute new binary versions, you are required to make the
entire source code available for free to everyone.

If you are going to publicly release modified versions of this code, you must
also make source code available.  I would encourage teams to even go a step
farther and investigate using public CVS servers such as sourceforge.net
for development where possible.

The primary intent of this release is for entertainment and educational
purposes, but the GPL does allow commercial exploitation if you obey the
full license.  If you want to do something commercial and you just can't bear
to have your source changes released, it is posible to still negotiate a
separate license agreement for money(check contact.txt for details).

Thanks to: Matt "WhiteFang" Ayres, Paul "Hsup" Hsu, Barnaby "VolVE" Claydon,
Aaron "TheRelentless" Bellante, Kenn Hwang, GX Media Inc. and everybody that
used to be in the dead #Qoole EFnet.
